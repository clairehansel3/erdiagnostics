Hiya Brendan,

I tried to make my code well documented, but email me if you have any questions.
I provided two example programs: 'nominal.py' and 'scan.py'. Below are
instructions on how to setup the workflow I use to run my programs. This is
simply my workflow and if you want to do it your own way feel free.

1) From your computer install homebrew using the command
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2) Clone SRW using the command
git clone https://github.com/ochubar/SRW

3) If you are on a machine that uses a command other than 'python' to launch the
version of python you use (e.g. if the command is 'python2' or 'python3'), you
need to edit SRW/cpp/py/Makefile line 8 and change
MODE=$(MODE) python setup.py build_ext --build-lib='../gcc'
into
MODE=$(MODE) <python-command> setup.py build_ext --build-lib='../gcc'
where <python-command> is the command you use to run python

4) Run 'make' from your SRW directory to build SRW.

5) Edit line 3 of 'nominal.py' and line 4 of 'scan.py' and replace
'/Users/claire/Desktop/software/SRW/env/work/srw_python'
with
'<path-to-srw-on-your-system>/env/work/srw_python'

6) You should be able to run nominal.py now. '<python command> nominal.py run'
does the time intensive computations and saves the result to a file called
'nominal_data', and '<python command> nominal.py analyze' reads that file and
plots the results.

7) Install a program called osxfuse. Don't use homebrew for this just
download the .dmg from the website.

8) Install sshfs with 'brew install sshfs'

9) Make a new terminal window. From terminal window 2 ssh into glen's computer
with 'ssh <slac-unix-username>@ar-pc90328.slac.stanford.edu'

10) From terminal window 2 run 'readlink -f .' to get the path to your home
foler, lets call it <path-to-home>.

11) From terminal window 1 (your local machine) make an empty folder called
'mount' and then run
'sshfs <slac-unix-username>@ar-pc90328.slac.stanford.edu:/ <path-to-mount>'
'cd <path-to-mount>/<path-to-home>'
both terminal window 1 and terminal window 2 should be in your home folder on
glen's computer, but the difference is that terminal window 1 will run something
from your local machine while terminal window 2 will run it on glen's computer.

12) Using terminal window 2 install SRW on glen's computer. Then edit nominal.py
line 4 and scan.py line 5 and replace
'/afs/slac.stanford.edu/u/ra/chansel/edge-radiation/SRW/env/work/srw_python'
with
'<path-to-srw-on-glens-computer>/env/work/srw_python'

13) You should be able to run 'nominal.py' on glen's computer now. Keep in mind
that glen's computer does not have matplotlib installed since there is no
windowing system, and so while you can run 'python nominal.py run' on glen's
computer (i.e. from terminal window 2), you must run
'<python-command> nominal.py analyze' from your local machine (i.e. terminal
window 1).

14) Install mpi4py on glens computer

15) edit 'scan.py' and change lines 15-17 from
data_directory = '/scratch/chansel/data'
data_directory_2 = '/Users/claire/Desktop/things/mount/scratch/chansel/data'
plot_directory = '/Users/claire/Desktop/scans_new_64'
to
data_directory '/scratch/brendan/data'
data_directory_2 = '<path-to-mount>/scratch/brenadan/data'
plot_directory = '<path-to-Desktop-on-your-computer>/scan_results'

16) you should now be able to run 'scan.py'. Edit 'run' and change
'/scratch/chansel' to '/scratch/brendan'. From terminal window 2 run
'nohup run &' to start a simulation. you can check up on the simulations
progress with 'cat /scratch/brendan/*.log' if you log out of terminal window 2
to let your scans run overnight, make sure to run
'diskutil Unmount <path-to-mount>' to unmount glens computer from your laptop.
If you get to work the next morning and realized you forgot to unmount make sure
to unmount and remount or else you could get the endless loading cursor. Once
your scan is done, from terminal 1 run '<python-command> scan.py plot' which
will copy the data to your local machine and then create a bunch of plots and
some movies. If you want the movies to work you'll need to run
'brew install ffmpeg'

17) Ok thats it!
